I setup this project using webpack to create react applications.


Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## How to run the project:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Runs the app in the production mode.<br>

### `npm test`

The jest utility scans the directory for files with names that end in test or spec, or files in a directory named __tests__.
